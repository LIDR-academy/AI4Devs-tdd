# Prompts for Test Development with Jest

## Analysis Request
As a specialist in test development using Jest, I want to analyze which codes are involved in the candidate insertion process in the database.

## Test Implementation Request
I want to rewrite the tests using Jest for the following cases:
- Candidate insertion
- Upload with CV file
- Insertion without CV file
- Rejection of invalid file types
