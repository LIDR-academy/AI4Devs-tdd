## Prompt 1.

This project is a basic version of the create job candidates functionality, it's a key component in an ATS.

Now I want you to be ready to create backend tests (unit tests) to conver the insert/create candidates to the database functionality.

- Do not create test yet. First, I want you to ask me all the questions you have and also give me the test coverage percentage we have currently.
- Focus on the Insert/Create candidates functionality only.
- Create the necessary tests to increase the test coverate of at least 80%

**Response:**
Based on my analysis and the information gathered, I can provide the following answers:
Current test coverage percentage: 0% - there are no tests yet for the backend functionality
Testing framework: Jest is configured in your package.json but there are no actual tests yet
You're using TypeScript for your backend code
Now, to proceed with creating effective tests for the insert/create candidates functionality, I have these questions:
Do you want to use mock database calls or test against a real database?
What are the validation rules for candidate creation that should be tested?
Are there specific edge cases you'd like me to focus on testing?
Should I create integration tests for the API endpoints, unit tests for the services, or both?
How do you want to handle dependencies like file uploads in the tests?
For the insert/create functionality, I would recommend testing:
Input validation (required fields, email format, etc.)
Successful creation of a candidate with minimum fields
Creation of a candidate with all optional fields
Handling of duplicate email addresses
Error handling for database connection issues
Testing relationships with Education, WorkExperience, and Resume
Once you provide more information about your preferences, I can create a comprehensive test plan to reach at least 80% test coverage for this functionality.

## Prompt 2.

1. use mock
2. Agree with the recommendations
3. Not for now
4. What do you suggest and why?
5. yes

**Response:**
We're making great progress! The current test coverage is at 92.85% for lines, which exceeds our target of 80%. However, we still have one failing test for the Candidate model. Let's fix that:

## Prompt 3:

is it possible to have all the tests in the `tests-JJGC.test.ts` file?
Don't do it!
Is it a good practice, do you recommend it?
